# Galactic_Lottery

This Python script attempts to find a private key that matches a specific set of Bitcoin addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. The script uses a brute-force approach to generate and check random private keys until it finds a match.

## How It Works

- **Libraries and Modules**: The script imports `hashlib` for hashing, `secrets` for generating random numbers, `ecdsa` for elliptic curve cryptography, `base58` for encoding, and `logging` for logging messages.
  
- **`hash_key()` Function**: This function takes a public key as input, hashes it using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms, and returns the resulting hash.
  
- **`private_key_to_wif()` Function**: Converts a private key integer to the Wallet Import Format (WIF) used in Bitcoin. It adds a prefix byte, appends a compression flag if specified, calculates a checksum, and encodes the result using Base58.
  
- **`try_keys()` Function**: The core of the script, it takes a starting value and the number of attempts made so far. It iterates over a range of 100 private keys starting from the given start value. For each private key, it generates the corresponding public key, hashes it using `hash_key()`, and checks if the resulting hash matches any of the Satoshi keys stored in the `satoshi_keys` list (imported from `KeyDatabase.py`). If a match is found, it converts the private key to WIF format and returns it. If no match is found after checking 100 keys, it returns None.
  
- **`main()` Function**: The entry point of the script. It initializes variables to keep track of the number of attempts and the found key. It enters a loop that continues until a matching private key is found. In each iteration, it generates a random starting value (a multiple of 100) using `secrets.randbelow()` and calls `try_keys()` with the starting value and the current number of attempts. If a key is found, the loop terminates. Otherwise, it increments the number of attempts by 100 and continues the loop.
  
- **Progress Display**: The script uses `print()` statements with `end=''` and `flush=True` to display the progress and results on the console, overwriting the previous line with each update.

## Note

It is extremely unlikely for this script to ever find a matching private key for any of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin addresses due to the vast size of the private key space and the security properties of the Bitcoin system.

## Reasons for Improbability

- **Enormous Key Space**: Bitcoin private keys are 256-bit numbers, which means there are 2^256 possible private keys, an astronomically large number.
  
- **Randomness of Private Keys**: Bitcoin private keys are generated using secure random number generators, making it highly unlikely to guess or stumble upon a specific private key.
  
- **Security of the Bitcoin System**: Bitcoin's use of elliptic curve cryptography and strong hash functions provides strong cryptographic security.
  
- **Probability Calculation**: The probability of finding a matching private key is approximately 10^-77.
  
- **Time and Resource Constraints**: Generating and checking private keys is computationally intensive, requiring an impractical amount of time and resources.
