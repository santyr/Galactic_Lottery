# Galactic_Lottery

A Python script that attempts to find a private key corresponding to a set of Bitcoin addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto. It leverages a combination of cryptographic operations and a Bloom filter to demonstrate the near-impossibility of brute-forcing a Bitcoin key.

## How It Works

1. **Libraries and Modules**  
   - **`hashlib`** for SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashing.  
   - **`base58`** for Base58 encoding.  
   - **`bitarray`** for implementing a Bloom filter.  
   - **[`secp256k1`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1)** for elliptic curve cryptography (via Python bindings).  
   - **`KeyDatabase`** (custom) for importing known Satoshi keys.

2. **`hash_key()` Function**  
   - Accepts a public key (in bytes), applies SHA-256, then RIPEMD-160, returning the resulting 20-byte hash.  
   - Mirrors part of Bitcoin’s standard address derivation process.

3. **`private_key_to_wif()` Function**  
   - Takes a 32-byte private key, prefixes with `0x80` (for mainnet), optionally adds `0x01` for compressed keys, then appends a 4-byte checksum (double SHA-256).  
   - The result is encoded in Base58 to produce the standard Wallet Import Format (WIF).

4. **`create_bloom_filter()` Function**  
   - Builds a Bloom filter from the known Satoshi keys, using a configurable false-positive rate to size the filter and determine the number of hash functions.  
   - Allows quick membership testing before performing a final set check.

5. **`try_keys()` Function**  
   - Continuously generates random private keys (via **libsecp256k1**).  
   - Extracts the compressed public key, hashes it, and consults the Bloom filter for a possible match.  
   - If potentially present, checks against the final set of Satoshi keys.  
   - Prints progress on a single line (updates in place) and terminates if a matching key is (improbably) found.

6. **`main()` Function**  
   - Loads Satoshi’s known keys, converts them into byte format, and inserts them into both a Python set and the Bloom filter.  
   - Invokes `try_keys()` to begin the brute-force process.  
   - Continues indefinitely unless a match is discovered (which is extraordinarily unlikely).

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Huge Key Space**: The private key space is \(2^{256}\), an unfathomably large number, rendering success virtually impossible.  
- **High Resource Usage**: Even with Bloom filter optimizations, this brute-force approach is CPU-intensive—and can make your computer quite warm.  
- **Ethical & Legal Implications**: Attempting to recover keys without permission is ethically and legally questionable.

## Improbability of Finding a Matching Key

- **256-bit Entropy**: There are approximately \(10^{77}\) possible private keys—more than the estimated atoms in the observable universe.  
- **Uniform Distribution**: Bitcoin private keys are generated with secure randomness, minimizing the chance of accidental collisions.  
- **Robust Cryptography**: The secp256k1 curve, SHA-256, and RIPEMD-160 are specifically chosen for their resistance to known attacks.  
- **Probability**: Even billions of attempts per second are negligible against \(2^{256}\).  
- **Time & Resources**: A successful match in our lifetimes (or the universe’s) is practically zero.
