# Galactic_Lottery

This Python script attempts to find a private key that matches a specific set of Bitcoin addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. The script uses a brute-force approach to generate and check random private keys until it finds a match.

## How It Works

- **Libraries and Modules**: The script imports `hashlib` for hashing, `secrets` for generating random numbers, `ecdsa` for elliptic curve cryptography, `base58` for encoding.
  
- **`hash_key()` Function**: This function takes a public key as input, hashes it using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms, and returns the resulting hash.
  
- **`private_key_to_wif()` Function**: Converts a private key integer to the Wallet Import Format (WIF) used in Bitcoin. It adds a prefix byte, appends a compression flag if specified, calculates a checksum, and encodes the result using Base58.
  
- **`try_keys()` Function**: The core of the script, it takes a starting value and the number of attempts made so far. It iterates over a range of 100 private keys starting from the given start value. For each private key, it generates the corresponding public key, hashes it using `hash_key()`, and checks if the resulting hash matches any of the Satoshi keys stored in the `satoshi_keys` list (imported from `KeyDatabase.py`). If a match is found, it converts the private key to WIF format and returns it. If no match is found after checking 100 keys, it returns None.
  
- **`main()` Function**: The entry point of the script. It initializes variables to keep track of the number of attempts and the found key. It enters a loop that continues until a matching private key is found. In each iteration, it generates a random starting value (a multiple of 100) using `secrets.randbelow()` and calls `try_keys()` with the starting value and the current number of attempts. If a key is found, the loop terminates. Otherwise, it increments the number of attempts by 100 and continues the loop.
  
- **Progress Display**: The script uses `print()` statements with `end=''` and `flush=True` to display the progress and results on the console, overwriting the previous line with each update.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The script relies on a brute-force approach, which is extremely unlikely to succeed due to the enormous size of the private key space and the cryptographic security measures in place.
- Attempting to find or guess private keys without permission raises ethical concerns and is likely illegal.
- The script is computationally intensive and requires significant time and resources to iterate through a meaningful portion of the key space.
- The script should not be used for any malicious purposes or to compromise the security and privacy of others' Bitcoin addresses.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Install the required dependencies: hashlib, secrets, ecdsa, base58.
3. Modify the KeyDatabase.py file to include the target Bitcoin addresses you wish to find the private keys for.
4. Run the script using a Python interpreter: python script_name.py.
5. The script will start generating and checking private keys, displaying the progress and any found matches on the console.

Please note that running this script is highly unlikely to yield any successful results and is primarily intended for educational and experimental purposes.
