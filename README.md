# Galactic_Lottery

This Python script attempts to find a private key that matches a specific set of Bitcoin addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. It uses a combination of cryptographic functions and a bloom filter approach to efficiently search for matching keys by generating random private keys and checking them against a predefined set.

## How It Works

- **Libraries and Modules**: The script leverages `hashlib` for hashing, `ecdsa` for elliptic curve cryptography, `base58` for encoding, `bitarray` for managing bloom filters, and a custom module `KeyDatabase` for Satoshi's known keys.
- **`hash_key()` Function**: Takes a public key as input, hashes it with SHA-256 followed by RIPEMD-160, and returns the hash. This double hashing is part of Bitcoin's address creation algorithm.
- **`private_key_to_wif()` Function**: Converts a private key to Wallet Import Format (WIF), adding necessary prefix and suffix bytes, calculating checksums, and encoding with Base58 to generate a standard Bitcoin private key in WIF.
- **`create_bloom_filter()` Function**: Initializes a bloom filter tailored to the set of target keys to streamline the search process, optimizing both the space used and the speed of the query.
- **`try_keys()` Function**: Iteratively generates keys, checks each against the bloom filter, and then performs a more detailed match against the Satoshi key set. If a match is found, the script outputs the WIF-formatted private key.
- **`main()` Function**: Coordinates the script's operations, setting up the bloom filter and initiating the key search process. It tracks and prints each key attempt, showing ongoing progress and results.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Due to the vast size of Bitcoin's key space, the probability of finding a specific key is extremely low, making this script largely experimental.
- The brute-force nature of the search, even with optimizations like a bloom filter, demands significant computational resources.
- Ethical and legal implications arise when attempting to access or use private keys without explicit permission.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install ecdsa base58 bitarray hashlib
